        "answer": "# Newton's Three Laws of Motion\n\n**First Law (Law of Inertia):**\nAn object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion at constant velocity, unless acted upon by an external force.\n\n*Example: A book on a table won't move until you push it; a hockey puck on ice keeps sliding until friction stops it.*\n\n**Second Law (F = ma):**\nThe force acting on an object equals its mass times its acceleration (F = ma). Or: acceleration is directly proportional to force and inversely proportional to mass.\n\n*Example: Pushing a shopping cart requires more force if it's full (more mass) or if you want it to speed up quickly (more acceleration).*\n\n**Third Law (Action-Reaction):**\nFor every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. When one object exerts a force on another, the second object exerts an equal force in the opposite direction on the first.\n\n*Example: When you jump, you push down on the ground, and the ground pushes up on you with equal force, propelling you upward.*\n\nThese laws, published by Isaac Newton in 1687, form the foundation of classical mechanics.",

According to the **Precession** article:\n\n> \"Torque-free precession implies that no external moment (torque) is applied to the body. In precession, the angular momentum is a constant, but the angular velocity vector changes orientation with time.\"\n\nThis demonstrates that angular momentum is conserved (remains constant) in the absence of external torque, even though the direction of rotation may change.\n\n## Example\n\nWhile the knowledge graph results don't provide a specific worked example of conservation of angular momentum, the **Angular momentum** article describes Earth's orbital angular momentum:\n\n> \"The orbital angular momentum of the Earth with respect to the Sun is a...\" (given by L = 2\u03c0Mfr\u00b2)\n\nThis can serve as an example: Earth maintains relatively constant angular momentum in its orbit around the Sun because no significant external torques act on the Earth-Sun system.
