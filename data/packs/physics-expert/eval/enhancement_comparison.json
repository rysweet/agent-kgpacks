Law of Inertia**\nAn object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion at constant velocity, unless acted upon by an external force.\n\n*Example: A book on a table won't move until you push it; a sliding hockey puck keeps going until friction stops it.*\n\n**2. Law of Acceleration (F = ma)**\nThe force acting on an object equals its mass times its acceleration. Or: acceleration is proportional to force and inversely proportional to mass.\n\n*Example: Pushing a shopping cart (small mass) is easier than pushing a car (large mass); a harder push produces more acceleration.*\n\n**3. Law of Action-Reaction**\nFor every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. When one object exerts a force on another, the second object exerts an equal force in the opposite direction on the first.\n\n*Example: When you jump, your legs push down on the ground, and the ground pushes up on you with equal force, propelling you upward.*\n\nThese laws, published by Isaac Newton in 1687, form the foundation of classical mechanics.",

        "answer": "# Physics of a Pendulum and Its Period\n\n## Basic Physics\n\nA **simple gravity pendulum** consists of \"a weight (or bob) on the end of a massless cord suspended from a pivot, without friction\" (Pendulum article). When displaced and released, it swings back and forth. The physics governing this motion is grounded in **Newton's laws of motion**, which describe how forces (gravity, in this case) cause acceleration and motion.\n\n## What Determines the Period\n\nAccording to the knowledge graph facts:\n\n**The period of a simple gravity pendulum depends on two factors:**\n1. **Length of the pendulum** (L)\n2. **Local strength of gravity** (g)\n\nImportantly, **the period is independent of the mass of the bob** \u2014 a lighter or heavier pendulum of the same length will swing with the same period.\n\n## Key Property: Isochronism\n\nFor small swings, the period remains \"approximately the same for different size swings, a property called **isochronism**\" (Knowledge Graph). This property made pendulums valuable for timekeeping throughout history.\n\n## Real vs. Idealized Pendulums\n\nThe article notes that real pendulums differ from the idealized model: \"Real pendulums are subject to friction and air drag, so the amplitude of their swings declines\" (Pendulum article), though the theoretical period formula remains approximately valid for small oscillations.",

In other words, angular momentum cannot be created or destroyed in an isolated system\u2014it can only be transferred or redistributed. [1][2]\n\n## Example\n\nA practical example is **torque-free precession**: when no external torque is applied to a rotating body, the angular momentum remains constant even though the angular velocity vector may change orientation. [1] \n\nAnother everyday example is a **spinning figure skater**: when a skater pulls their arms inward, their moment of inertia decreases, causing their angular velocity to increase to conserve angular momentum. The total angular momentum stays the same, but it is redistributed as the body's configuration changes.

When torque equals zero (no external forces), angular momentum L remains constant over time.
