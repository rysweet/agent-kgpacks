        "answer": "# Newton's Three Laws of Motion\n\n**First Law (Law of Inertia):**\nAn object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion at constant velocity, unless acted upon by an external force.\n\n*Example: A book on a table won't move until you push it; a hockey puck keeps sliding on ice until friction stops it.*\n\n**Second Law (F = ma):**\nThe force acting on an object equals its mass multiplied by its acceleration. Or: acceleration is proportional to force and inversely proportional to mass.\n\n*Example: Pushing a shopping cart (lighter) is easier than pushing a car (heavier); harder pushes create greater acceleration.*\n\n**Third Law (Action-Reaction):**\nFor every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. When one object exerts a force on another, the second object exerts an equal force in the opposite direction.\n\n*Example: When you jump, you push down on the ground, and the ground pushes you up; a rocket expels gas downward and is thrust upward.*\n\nThese laws, published in 1687, form the foundation of classical mechanics and describe how objects behave when forces act upon them.",

When displaced and released, it oscillates back and forth.\n\nThe physics involves the interplay between two forms of mechanical energy:\n- **Potential energy** (U): Depends on the bob's position/height as it's subjected to gravity\n- **Kinetic energy** (K): Energy of motion as the bob swings\n\nTotal mechanical energy E = U + K transfers between these modes during oscillation. This energy exchange is an example of **resonance**, where a system \"store[s] and easily transfer[s] energy between two or more different storage modes\" (Resonance article).\n\n## What Determines the Period\n\nAccording to the knowledge graph, **the period of a simple gravity pendulum depends on two factors:**\n\n1. **Length of the cord** (L)\n2. **Local strength of gravity** (g)\n\nImportantly, **the period is independent of the mass of the bob**.\n\nAdditionally, pendulums exhibit **isochronism**: for small swings, the period remains approximately constant regardless of swing size. This property \"makes pendulums useful for timekeeping\" (Pendulum article).\n\nFor compound (non-simple) pendulums, the period depends on the mass distribution of the pendulum, expressed as an \"equivalent length\" or \"radius of oscillation\" (Pendulum article).",

        "answer": "# Conservation of Angular Momentum\n\n## Explanation\n\nConservation of angular momentum states that when no external torque is applied to a system, the angular momentum remains constant over time.\n\nAccording to the **Precession** article in the knowledge graph: \"Torque-free precession implies that no external moment (torque) is applied to the body. In precession, the angular momentum is a constant, but the angular velocity vector changes orientation with time.\"\n\n## Example\n\nA practical example is found in the **Precession** article's description of torque-free precession: When a spinning object experiences no external torque, its angular momentum **L** stays constant in magnitude and direction. However, the angular velocity vector can change its orientation in space. This occurs because the object's moment of inertia (or inertia matrix) redistributes how the angular momentum is expressed, allowing the axis of rotation to precess while the total angular momentum remains fixed.\n\nThis principle is fundamental to rotating bodies\u2014as stated in the **Moment of inertia** article, \"When a body is free to rotate around an axis, torque must be applied to change its angular momentum,\" meaning that without applied torque, the angular momentum is conserved.",
