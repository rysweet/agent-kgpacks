The motion follows x(t) = A cos(\u03c9t + \u03c6), where A is amplitude, \u03c9 is angular frequency, and \u03c6 is phase constant. SHM occurs in mass-spring systems, pendulums (for small angles), and many other oscillating systems. The period T = 2\u03c0/\u03c9 is independent of amplitude. SHM is important for understanding waves, vibrations, and AC circuits.", "domain": "classical_mechanics", "difficulty": "medium"}

{"id": "physics_060", "question": "What is the Kerr metric?", "ground_truth": "The Kerr metric describes the geometry of spacetime around a rotating black hole, extending the Schwarzschild solution to include angular momentum. Discovered by Roy Kerr in 1963, this solution shows that rotating black holes have two event horizons and an ergosphere region where spacetime is dragged so strongly that remaining stationary is impossible. The Kerr metric predicts frame dragging, closed timelike curves near the singularity, and provides the most realistic model for astrophysical black holes, which are expected to rotate.", "domain": "relativity", "difficulty": "hard"}

In the ergosphere (the region between the event horizon and the static limit), particles can have negative energy relative to infinity. If an object enters the ergosphere, splits into two pieces, and one piece falls into the black hole with negative energy while the other escapes, the escaping piece has more energy than the original object. This process extracts rotational energy from the black hole, slowing its spin.", "domain": "relativity", "difficulty": "hard"}
{"id": "physics_065", "question": "What is the law of conservation of energy?", "ground_truth": "The law of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only converted from one form to another. In a closed system, the total energy remains constant. Energy can transform between kinetic, potential, thermal, chemical, nuclear, and other forms, but the sum is conserved.

Even if a system returns to its original state, its wave function may acquire a phase factor that depends only on the path taken through parameter space, not on the dynamics of evolution. This phase is observable through interference experiments and has applications in understanding the quantum Hall effect, molecular dynamics, and quantum computing.

{"id": "physics_071", "question": "What is latent heat?", "ground_truth": "Latent heat is the energy absorbed or released during a phase transition at constant temperature. During melting, freezing, vaporization, or condensation, added heat changes the phase rather than temperature. Latent heat of fusion is energy for solid-liquid transition; latent heat of vaporization is for liquid-gas transition. For water, the latent heat of vaporization (2260 kJ/kg) is much larger than the latent heat of fusion (334 kJ/kg).

It measures how much a machine multiplies force. For a lever, MA = distance from fulcrum to effort / distance from fulcrum to load. For pulleys, MA equals the number of supporting ropes. While mechanical advantage can amplify force, it cannot create energy\u2014greater output force requires greater input distance (work = force \u00d7 distance).

An electron beam passing around a shielded magnetic field region shows interference pattern shifts that depend on the magnetic flux, despite never entering a region with non-zero magnetic field. This demonstrates that in quantum mechanics, the electromagnetic potential has physical significance beyond being just a mathematical tool, challenging classical intuition.", "domain": "quantum_mechanics", "difficulty": "hard"}
{"id": "physics_075", "question": "What is thermal equilibrium?", "ground_truth": "Thermal equilibrium is the state where two or more systems in thermal contact have no net heat flow between them because they are at the same temperature. When systems at different temperatures are brought into contact, heat flows from hot to cold until equilibrium is reached. At thermal equilibrium, all parts of the system have the same temperature, though different parts may have different energies or pressures.
